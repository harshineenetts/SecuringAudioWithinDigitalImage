I offer two modes of installation:

1) standalone:
- Install choosing the option "Use a File Installation Key" and supply the following FIK
	09806-07443-53955-64350-21751-41297
- 
- Use license_standalone.lic to activate,
  or make a "licenses" folder in %installdir% and copy license_standalone.lic to it,and run matlab without activation
- after the installation finishes copy the folders to %installdir% to overwriting the originally installed files
